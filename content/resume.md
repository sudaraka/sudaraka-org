## Education

For primary and secondary education, Sudaraka attended [D.S.Senanayake College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._S._Senanayake_College)
at Colombo. Sudaraka maintained above average grades during the primary
education period  and received excellent result on his GCE O/L examination in
1996, including distinctions on core subjects among which are Mathematics,
Science, Commerce & Accountancy and First/Second Languages. (Overall Six
distinctions and two credits).

Secondary education period was not a high point of Sudaraka's life as during
that time he was mostly distracted by his new found fascination of computer
programming. One year into high-school, Sudaraka dropped out and focused on
his research and self-study of computer programming.

However, Sudaraka sat for the GCE A/L examination in 1999 which returned
unsuccessful result with only a simple pass in the subject of Physics.

In late 1999 Sudaraka enrolled for a Diploma course in Computer System Design
at the [National Institute of Business Management (NIBM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Business_Management_%28Sri_Lanka%29).
Sudaraka completed the course and the compulsory project, however did not
archive the required grades for the certification. Without perusing it
further Sudaraka dropped out of NIBM in 2001 and continued self-studying and
research, and also started his career as a computer programmer.

Another stage of formal education in Sudaraka's life was in 2002, when the
company he was working for ([iDial Lanka](#idial-lanka-pvt-ltd)) offered him
a grant for the Microsoft® certification program. Sudaraka archived the MCP
status, however did not peruse remainder of the certifications. (Today as a
FLOSS lover Sudaraka is not that proud of this achievement.)

In general Sudaraka is not a fan of conventional class room education, from
the childhood he preferred Learning-by-doing approach. Although Sudaraka
distanced him self from "formal education", he continues to self-study and
research on the subjects of Computer Programming and Electronics.
