> I consider Suda a top notch web designer! He stays current on all issues concerning web design, he is continually educating himself which gives us higher rankings in the search engines. Suda is always on top of our needs and responds very quickly. His costs beat anyone we have researched. You just can't beat this web designer. We feel that we have the best man looking out for us. He is very understanding even though we don't always know the right way to communicate what we desire. He is simply the best guy to work with all around and I highly recommend him for any web work!
